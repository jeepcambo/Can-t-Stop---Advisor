# CantStop-Advisor

This program uses an algorithm to advise the player whether he should roll again or stop in Can't Stop. Currently, it uses the Rule of 28 algorithm.

Future work may include a genetic algorithm from https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FLAIRS/2009/paper/viewFile/123/338 to better optimize play.
